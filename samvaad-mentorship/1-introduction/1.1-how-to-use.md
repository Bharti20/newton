## How to Use

### Conversation Cards
This course has a section which contains all the topics that volunteers can have a dialogue with the students on. These topics are in the form of a 'Coversation Card' which is open for both the students and the volunteers. This Conversation Card includes the name of the topic, some sub-topics and questions, and some informative resources to read up. The volunteers can choose to use the cards as a guideline for the conversation.

Here is a sample.
