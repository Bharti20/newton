# Basics of Scraping

## TODO

How can we scrape in Python?
- HTML is rendered by browsers. But we can get the same HTML in Python using requests. Show how to install requests.
- Print the same HTML in the Terminal which you got.
- Install BeautifulSoup and show how we can get the title and a few other tags to give a basic glimpse into BeautifulSoup of a page using Beautiful Soup?
