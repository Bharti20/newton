1. 12 typists working for 4 hours to type a book in 18 days. In how many days 4 typists will work for 8 hours to type same book?

            Solution:
            This is a situation of indirect variation.
            12 typists working for 4 hours type a book in 18 days
            1 typist working for 4 hours types a book in 18 × 12 days.
            1 typist working for 1 hour types a book in 18 × 12 × 4 days.
            4 typists working for 1 hour type a book in (18 × 12 × 4)/4
            4 typists working for 8 hours type a book in (18 × 12 × 4)/(4 × 8) days.
            Therefore, 4 typists working for 8 hours type a book in 27 days.
            

2. 16 men can build a wall in 56 hours. How many men will be required to do the same work in 32 hours?

            Solution:
            This is a situation of inverse variation.
            More the number of men, the faster will they build the wall.
            In 56 hours, the wall is built by 16 men.
            In 1 hour, the wall is built by 16 × 56 men.
            In 32 hours, the wall is built by (16 × 56)/32 men
            Therefore, in 32 hours, the wall is built by 28 men.


3. If 72 workers can do a piece of work in 40 days, in how many days will 64 workers complete the same work?

            Solution:
            This is a situation of indirect variation.
            Less workers will require more days to complete the work.
            72 workers can do the work in 40 days
            1 worker can do the same work in 72 × 40 days
            64 workers can do the same work in (72 × 40)/64
            Therefore, 64 workers can do the same work in 45 days.
