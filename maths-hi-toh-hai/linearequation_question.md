Problem 1
Solve the equation 8+2(x-4)=16.
 
Solution:
First, we remove the parentheses and get 8+2x-2⋅4=16, or 8+2x-8=16, which gives us 2x=16. We divide by 2 in order to get x=8.
 
 
Problem 2
Solve the equation 3(n+15)=30+6n.
 
Solution:
We first remove the parentheses on the left side and get 3n+3⋅15=30+6n, or 3n+45=30+6n. We substract 3n from both sides and get 45=30+3n. We substract 30 from both sides and get 15=3n. By dividing both sides by 3, we get the final answer n=5. 
Second solution: we divide both sides by 3, getting n+15=10+2n. Substracting n from both sides, we get 15=10+n. The final answer is reached by substracting 10 from both sides.

    a)1234
    b)2345
    c)2378
    d)5643
 
Problem 5

    a)-23
    b)-12
    c)-56
    d)-23

 
 
Problem 6

    a)0
    b)1
    c)2
    d)3
 
 
Level :Difficult
 
Problem 1
A number is equal to 7 times itself minus 18. Which is the number?
Solution:
The statement is equivalent to the following equation:

    x=7x−18
    18=7x−x
    6x=18
    x=3
 
 
Problem 2
A number is equal to 4 times this number less 75. What is the number?
Solution:
Let us denote the number with n. The problem can be rewritten as n=4n-75. By substracting n from both sides, we get 3n-75=0. Now we divide both sides by 3 to get n-25=0, or n=25.
 
Problem 3
Two times a number, decreased by 12 equals three times the number, decreased by 15. Which is the number?

    a)2
    b)3
    c)7
    d)9
 
 
Problem 4
