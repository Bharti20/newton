### Strategies to Read and Comprehend
1. **Make a vocabulary list before you begin.**
In the excerpt above, you might have noticed some words you don’t know. Some words are more important to understand than others (we’ll learn more about that in the second tip). Before you read a text, skim it for words you don’t know and make a list with definitions.

Look for:

Words that are repeated more than once.
Unknown words in short sentences.
Words you’ve seen in other places.
Here’s a possible vocabulary list for our sample text:

Instinctive: Something you do or know how to do without needing to learn it.
Etched: Something that is carved into a surface, or something that is remembered very well.
Circuitry: A closed route or path that something takes—usually an electric current.

2. **Don’t define every word.**
As mentioned in tip #1, you don’t need to know every word to understand the text. Stopping to define every word takes time and distracts you from understanding the text.

When you come across a word you don’t know, ask yourself if you can understand the sentence without it.

In our sample text, the last sentence of the first paragraph says:

“And the media or other technologies we use in learning and practicing the craft of reading…”

You might not know what the word “craft” means, but you don’t really need to! If you skip over it, you can still understand the sentence: “And the media or other technologies we use in learning and practicing reading.”

3. **Use context clues.**
The great thing about sentences is that you give new words context. This means the unknown word is surrounded by other words which clarify its meaning. By looking at the words that come before and after an unknown word, you can often figure out the basic meaning.

For example, the end of the last sentence in the first paragraph talks about the “neural circuits inside our brains.” What are neural circuits? By looking at the rest of the sentence, you can tell that neural circuits are something we have inside our brains.

If you made a list of vocabulary words before starting to read, you might already know that a circuit is a closed route that electricity takes. So you might guess that a neural circuit is the path that signals in our brains take when we think, act or learn something. And you’d be right!

4. **Break up sentences into chunks**
Now that you understand single words, you can apply your new knowledge to full sentences. Some sentences can be difficult to follow because you are long or have a complicated structure. Make them easier to understand by breaking them up into smaller pieces. You can separate sentences by commas, or by thoughts and ideas.

The first sentence in the second paragraph is quite long:

“Experiments demonstrate that readers of ideograms, such as the Chinese, develop a mental circuitry for reading that is very different from the circuitry found in those of us whose written language employs an alphabet.”

Try to break it apart and take it one piece at a time. It can be helpful to restate each part in your own words. It might look something like this:

> Experiments demonstrate that — studies show that
readers of ideograms — people who read characters (which show meaning instead of sounds)
such as the Chinese — Chinese people are an example of ideogram readers
develop a mental circuitry for reading — create paths in their brains when you read
that is very different from the circuitry — which are not like the paths
found in those of us whose written language employs an alphabet — found in people who use an alphabet
Since you understand the different parts of the sentence, you can put it together in your own words now:

Studies show that people who read characters instead of an alphabet (like Chinese people, for example) have very different brain paths for reading than those of people who do use an alphabet.

5. **Look for related words and ideas.**
Understanding every sentence is a good start, but now it’s time to link all the sentences together and understand the full text. You can do that by looking for words and ideas that are related, and making sure you understand how you go together.

One way to do that is by looking for repeated words and phrases. This method works well in our example since the word “circuit” is repeated many times in just two paragraphs.

The first paragraph points out that how we read changes how our brains make sense of the information (using neural circuits). The second paragraph shows a more specific example of this. It states that people who read using an alphabet and people who read using ideograms have very different brain circuits.

Your text might not have repeating words. In that case, you can also look for bold words, words in italics or dialogue found between “quotation marks.”

If you’re reading fiction, you can look for feelings or emotions for a hint on what’s happening to the characters and their response to it. In non-fiction, time-related words and phrases like “before,” “then,” “soon after,” and others can help you organize the information.

Just by following the word “circuit” in our text, you almost understand the full text. Now there’s just one more tip to look at.

6. **Read and summarize.**
You understand the words. You understand the sentences. You’re even beginning to understand the ideas. Now stop! Read the text again and try to summarize it. Describe the main points and ideas using your own words.

After going through the text little by little using these seven tips, you should be able to understand it a lot better than when you read it for the first time. Here’s a summary of the text, using simpler words:

Reading is not something we do naturally, so our brains need to learn how to change the letters on a page into actual meaning. How and where we read can change the way our brains make this change.

Studies have shown that our brains work in very different ways when we read an alphabetical text than when we read a text of ideograms (like Chinese characters). This probably means that our brains also work differently when we read text online than when we read text from a physical book.

In other words, you might be changing the way your brain works right now, just by reading these words on a screen instead of a printed page. Pretty crazy!

7. **Skim and scan.**

 Scanning a text means looking for a specific part or for the answer to a specific question. Skimming a text means letting your eyes look over the text quickly without really reading every word. These are both excellent strategies to use before you start reading. you will let you understand a little bit about the text or topic so you have a rough idea of what you’re going to read about.

 8. **Drawing Inferences**
You can generate information that is important to constructing meaning but that is missing from, or not explicitly stated in, the text.

You can look for key words that will help in understanding the text, demonstrating how you can draw inferences from these words. 

9. **Asking Questions**
By generating questions, you become aware of whether you can answer the questions and if you understand what you are reading. You learn to ask yourself questions that require you to combine information from different segments of text. For example, you can be taught to ask main idea questions that relate to important information in a text.
