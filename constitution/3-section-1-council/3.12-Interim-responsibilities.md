## Interim Responsibilities

In the event that a council member has to leave campus for few days such that they are not able to fulfil their responsibilities, it is their duty to handover the council responsibility to someone who will take care of it in their absence.

* Absence for <= 7 days: Handover responsibility to any existing Council member
* Absence for > 7 days: Nominate three people who can take your place and Council votes

Any Council member who is absent from council without handing over responsibility will be asked to resign from the Council. They will further not be eligible to participate in the following elections.
