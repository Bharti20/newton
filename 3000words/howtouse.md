## How to Use

This course will help you to learn basic vocabulary. This is extremely important as without knowing words, one cannot understand sentences and therefore cannot read. You will also find it difficult to understand what someone is saying when you are in a conversation, watching a movie or listening to a song. Vocabulary is, thus, an important part of your English learning. So go on. Learn these words and start reading and listening better!
