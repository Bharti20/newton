# Compressing Files with the zipfile Module
You may be familiar with ZIP files (with the .zip file extension), which can hold the compressed contents of many other files. Compressing a file reduces its size, which is useful when transferring it over the Internet. And since a ZIP file can also contain multiple files and subfolders, itâ€™s a handy way to package several files into one. This single file, called an archive file, can then be, say, attached to an email.

Your Python programs can both create and open (or extract) ZIP files using functions in the zipfile module. Say you have a ZIP file named example.zip that has the contents shown in Figure 9-2.

You can download this ZIP file from <span><a href="http://nostarch.com/automatestuff/">http://nostarch.com/automatestuff/</a></span> or just follow along using a ZIP file already on your computer.
